# GEMINI.md

This file provides instructions for Gemini on how to interact with this Java project.

## Project Overview

This is a simple Java application that prints a basic "Hello, World!" to the console. This project also includes logging functionality with SLF4J and Logback.

## Development Environment

- **JDK Version**: This project requires **Java 21**.
- **Environment**: The use of a **Dev Container** is recommended for a consistent development environment.

## Dependencies

The project dependencies are managed by Maven in `pom.xml`. Key dependencies include:

- **Checkstyle**: `com.puppycrawl.tools:checkstyle`
- **Guava**: `com.google.guava:guava`
- **SLF4J API**: `org.slf4j:slf4j-api`
- **Logback**: `ch.qos.logback:logback-classic`
- **JUnit**: `junit:junit`
- **Hamcrest Core**: `org.hamcrest:hamcrest-core`

## Coding Style

This project uses the **Google Java Style Guide**. Compliance is enforced by **Checkstyle**.

The style check is automatically run as part of the build. To run the check, execute:

```sh
./mvnw checkstyle:check
```

## Logging Policy

This project uses SLF4J and Logback for logging. The configuration is in `src/main/resources/logback.xml`, and logs are written to the console and to the `logs/app.log` file.

Log levels are used as follows:

- `ERROR`: For fatal errors that prevent the system from continuing.
- `WARN`: For potential problems.
- `INFO`: For normal operational information (e.g., application start/stop).
- `DEBUG`: For detailed information useful for debugging.
- `TRACE`: For even more fine-grained information than DEBUG.

## Testing Policy

1. **Framework**: Tests are written using **JUnit 4**.
2. **Scope**: The focus is on unit tests. Each new class `Foo.java` should have a corresponding test class `FooTest.java`.
3. **Location**: Test classes are located in the `src/test/java` directory.
4. **Execution**: Run tests using `./mvnw test`. All tests must pass for a change to be considered complete.
5. **Test Reports**: An HTML test report can be generated by running `./mvnw site`. The report will be available at `target/site/surefire-report.html`.

## Documentation Policy

1. **Format**: Public APIs (classes, methods, and fields) should be documented using **Javadoc** comments.
2. **Style**: Follow the conventions outlined in the **Google Java Style Guide's** section on Javadoc. This ensures consistency with the overall code style.
3. **Generation**: The `maven-javadoc-plugin` is configured in `pom.xml` to generate a Javadoc JAR from the source code.
4. **Build Integration**: The Javadoc JAR is automatically generated as part of the `mvn clean install` command.
5. **Manual Generation**: To generate the Javadoc documentation manually, run the following command. The output will be in the `target/site/apidocs` directory.

    ```sh
    ./mvnw javadoc:javadoc
    ```

## Build

To build the project, run the following command. This command downloads dependencies, runs the Checkstyle linter, and compiles the source code.

```sh
./mvnw clean install
```

## Run

To run the application, use the following command:

```sh
./mvnw exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="internal.dev.App"
```

## Test

To run the project's tests, use the following command.

```sh
./mvnw test
```
